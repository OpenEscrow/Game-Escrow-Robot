or: "How to achieve a Riskless Trade using a Game Escrow Robot!"

Trade any Game item, currency, or Account! Steps: Seller establishes proof of ownership of Items/Accounts they'd like to sell. Buyer contracts to buy it & establishes proofOfFunds(). We now use an Escrow Process: Move the sellers funds to "Pending" and have the buyer submit all account information. We now lock the seller out of his/her account until the trade is complete, by changing the email password & MFA Recovery or Authenticator using UniKey.Escrow(). We take control of the buyers account (no lock required) to go to the Meeting place & receive the item. A Robot completes the trade and restores the seller's account back to it's previous Login! Both parties have completed a trade with no risk.
